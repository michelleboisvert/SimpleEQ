//SimpleEQ
Following MatKat's YouTube tutorial, I developed a SimpleEQ plug-in that includes filters: low-pass, high-pass, and a peak filter, by-pass buttons, and a GUI to display the information changed when using the plug-in. The tutorial I followed is linked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Iq4_Kd7Rc
